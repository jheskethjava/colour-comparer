# ColourComparer 2020

## Credit
I lifted this colour list from the Little Greene paint website in 2020. There are a couple from Earthborn Paints too.

If you like these colours, go to https://www.littlegreene.com/paint and https://earthbornpaints.co.uk

I don't have any connection with either company, except our kitchen is painted in their paints!

## Purpose
This project was born out of necessity. We were picking colours for our new kitchen and were trying to visualise how different combinations of colours would look together.

I was also interested to explore colours and the effect of different combinations of RGB and LRV (light reflective value, ie how dark it is) so I had a mess-about with some filtering and sorting.

## Overview
There are two pages:
1. doColours.html displays all or a subset of the colours. It will add the next selection right after the others, sorted by the selected option. Click on Clear Colours to reset.
2. doIt.html compares 3 colours together. Select your chosen colour and then set it as the main colour, colour 1 or colour 2. If you like your combination you can click 'Copy colours' to copy it below. Reset everything by refreshing the page. You can't undo. The only way to save your copied colours for later is to save the webpage.
